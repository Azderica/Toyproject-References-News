# Toyproject-References-News

This Service produce Developer References News in Korea to slack or other messanger. This service may be API Service, so this project is back-end service..

## How to make this project?

I love [this git](https://github.com/brave-people/Dev-Event). So, I want to parse data in this git repository.

Dev-Event => Site Crawling => Server => API => Slack / Messanger
